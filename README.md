# ScriptTest
ScriptTest is a Tampermonkey userscript that allows you to test Javascript snippets against each other for speed. Inspired by jsperf.com, ScriptTest was created to fill that hole (since jsperf is usually down anymore).

Requirements: Google Chrome, Tampermonkey

You can install this script from https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26313-scripttest Alternatively you can copy the js file and paste it into a new script in Tampermonkey.
